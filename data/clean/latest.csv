Australia is a major exporter of beef, wheat, barley, sugar, cotton, sorghum, oats, almonds and other commodities, and it has a substantial freight advantage over suppliers in the Americas and Western Europe in serving the world’s largest and fastest growing markets in Asia. But with the country embroiled in a trade spat with China, a major and inefficient rerouting of several commodity supply lines is underway as exporters scramble to replace that single mammoth buyer with dozens of smaller and farther-flung alternatives.   
   
The Australia Agriculture Correspondent’s reporting will also show the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector. Within the past decade, the country has suffered major droughts, horrendous bushfires and widespread flooding that have curbed or damaged large-scale rural investments and undermined lender confidence in the long-term viability of the Australian farm sector.  
   
Based in our office in Parliament House in Canberra, the successful candidate will also be the face of Reuters for politicians, industry bodies and government departments in the capital, will cover major government announcements on a range of issues, and will work with a team of specialist beat reporters across the Australian bureau.   
 

**About the Role**  
As our Australia Agriculture Correspondent, you will:

* Have a knack for reporting and writing high-impact stories
* Build sources across government, industry, and market participants
* Be able to Identify and develop exclusive news stories that will distinguish Reuters from other media
* Collaborate closely with reporters in Australia and in other regions
* Work with multimedia teams including pictures, graphics and video

   
To be our Australia Agriculture Correspondent, you will likely have:

* Experience covering commodity/financial markets
* Strong news judgement
* Ability to filter quickly through complex information to identify and explain key news elements
* Skill with social media news gathering and monitoring
* Experience working in real-time news bureau

* **Global Career**: As a global company, we can offer a truly international career and progression opportunities
